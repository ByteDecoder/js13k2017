you spend the game finding enough body parts to escape and explore a wasteland of greeble trash.

immediately the goal seems to be to find your body parts and get back to above.

making it above, you're dismantled again, cavern explore restarts. -LOSE BUT CONTINUE

you discover that you're not alone, and find a community of other discarded robots -WIN
