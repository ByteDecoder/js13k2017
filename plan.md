Greeble

tiny yellow flying robot is dismantled and shoveled into a cavernous trash heap.

you spend the game finding enough body parts to escape and explore a wasteland of greeble trash.

immediately the goal seems to be to find your body parts and get back to above.

making it above, you're dismantled again, cavern explore restarts. -LOSE BUT CONTINUE

you discover that you're not alone, and find a community of other discarded robots -WIN
  score: parts discovered + time

MVP todo:
set up beginning! -must portray type of game and wow judges immediately.
exploration-type games don't fare well, excitement needs to happen right when game begins.
long fall, showing surface of planet and junk caverns

part collection / play stages:
  rolly head. limited capacity to hop around, must find energy source before system failure (timer)
  body, aux thrusters online. (higher jump)
  arm, energy capacity increased, phase disruptor armed (for mining)
  lower body / wheel: self-sustaining power online, flight enabled (no longer need energy packs)

win state:
  -rejoin your bot crew, or investigate other mystery -might run out of dev time for this bit






item collection
  fuel for thrusters <--our 'coins'
  body parts --power ups.
    ideas:
    jump boosts: jump a bit higher
    auxillery thrusters. -game starts with limited mobility
    eyes. -game starts with limited/monochrome visibility


room structure
todo:
  data for background generation
  data for items in the room;
  data for interactive items in the room;

room drawing:
  procedural under/dark stuff, hanging cables
  larger panel generation, better heirarchy of form, more interesting visuals
  background generation, columns, etc


gameplay nice-to-haves:
hazards
NPC bots to follow


nuts and bolts:
room based platformer, no scrolling cam.  


graphics ideas:
greeble procedural generation. rooms will be planned, but decoration procedural.


polish ideas:
  meters, lights, oscilliscopes that flash in time with the music
  -webaudio visualizer > sprite drawing

  screenbuffer effects, particles
